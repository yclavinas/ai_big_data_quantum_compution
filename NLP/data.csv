 INI Parsing tool is a tool which accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File respectively which will be read by server to resister the commands,1
 Involved in the development testing verification of the module on windows,1
Man Machine Language MML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments,1
 It uses Client/Server architecture,1
 MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment,1
 It receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process it,1
 After acquiring the processing result the server generates a MML report and sends it back to the client,1
 It interacts with other system modules,1
 Connection Management Authorization Management Command Process Data Synchronization Event Notification Command Parsing LOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server,1
 Involved in the development defect fixing and verification of the module on windows Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities,1
Configuration Management Configuration Management Module is core module of System Management,1
 Its main function is to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration tool layer and the application layer and provide related configuration command communication mechanism,1
 Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the functionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data,1
 All configuration commands can be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type,1
 Configuration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be loaded to provide a persistent storage amp retrieval mechanism for applications static configuration data,1
 Involved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows Linux and vxworks platforms Involved in several release activities,1

 The receiving system will check the data and decrypt according to the specific algorithm and display on the LCD,1
 The RF module used here are Bluetooth of 9,1

Project Title Analytical RDH Approach For Image and Video Processing Using Reserving Room Before Encryption ,1
Brief Description of the Project Reversible data hiding RDH approach in image and video processing is a ,1
technique where the information of a original cover is recovered using lossless approach The data extraction is done once the extraction of embedded message is successfully recovered,1
 The applications of reversible data hiding are in medical imagery military imagery and law forensics where no distortion of the original content is allowed,1
 In the reversible data hiding method First empty room is made by embedding LSBs of some pixels into other pixels with RDH method and then encrypt the image so the positions of these LSBs in the encrypted image can be used to embed data ,1
In the first phase a content owner encrypts the original uncompressed image using an encryption key,1
 Then a datahider compress the least significant bits of the encrypted image using a datahiding key to create a sparse space to accommodate some additional data,1
 If the receiver has both key datahiding key and the encryption key it can extract the secret data and recover the original image,1
