PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN  • MINI PROJECT - \"WATER LEVEL INDICATION USING ALARAM\"  • MAIN PROJECT - \"ARDUINO BASED ENERGY CONSERVATION SYSTEM WITH SENSOR ARRAY AND REAL TIME MONITORING\"  This project is based on relay circuit and microcontroller which control the power wastage and give the live data of current, power consumption and power conservation. The heart of our project is UNO based AT mega 328p. Microcontroller is interfaced with laptop, pc, relay circuit and LCD.Relay circuit provides controlled power supply to appliances like fan, Ac. There is an external 5 volt is supplied to LCD, Microcontroller and Relay circuit.LCD is used for live monitoring of power through which we can able to see power consumption, power conservation and current monitoring. The Arduino energy conservation system decrease the power lose with using sensor and relay circuit. Arduino controller board will be used along with Temperature, Humidity, Light & Current sensor for data gathering and analysis. Thereof depending on the result of data analyses, relay circuits will be activated to control the home appliances to reduce power consumption.
